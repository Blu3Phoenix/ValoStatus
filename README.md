# ValoStatus

ValoStatus is a software that uses a third-party API to obtain the **ACCOUNT** and **MMR**<br>
data of a player from the Valorant video game.

# How to use ‚ùì
Its operation is very simple. All you have to enter is the following data of the player in question:
- **Username**
- **Tag**
- **Region**
    - **AP** (Asia)
    - **EU** (Europe)
    - **KR** (Korea)
    - **NA** (North America) [Brazil and LATAM become NA internally in the API]

Once that's done, simply hit the **"Find Player"** button and wait for the results.

# Third-party API üî∞

ValoStatus uses the **API** created by developer [Henrik-3](https://github.com/Henrik-3)
The **API** in question is called [unofficial-valorant-api](https://github.com/Henrik-3/unofficial-valorant-api)
All **API** credits go to its developer
